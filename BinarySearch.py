# Binary Search Algorithm
# Create a random list of numbers between 0 and 100
# with a difference of 2 between each number. Ask the
# user for a number between 0 and 100 to check whether
# their number is in the list. The programme should work
# like this. The programme will half the list of numbers and
# see whether the users number matches the middle element
# in the list. If they do not match, the programme will check
# which half the number lies in, and eliminate the other half.
# The search then continues on the remaining half, again checking
# whether the middle element in that half is equal to the userâ€™s
# number. This process keeps on going until the programme finds the
# users number, or until the size of the subarray is 0, which means
# the users number isn't in the list.
